# Creating-a-Child-Process-fork-and-exec-
Understand process creation and management in Linux by writing a C program that forks a child process. The child process will execute another program (get_ancestors, from the previous task) to retrieve and display its own ancestors. The parent process waits for the child and prints a message after it finishes.
